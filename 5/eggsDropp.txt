I remember this exercise in the algorithms class, 
the main idea is to use the first egg to reduce your sample space, and with the second egg go 
testing by iteration, for example if you throw the egg from floor 15 then increase, 
for example to 30 and break on 30, then you use the second egg to iterate starting from 16 
and increase untill the egg break.
